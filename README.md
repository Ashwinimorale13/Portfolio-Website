# Portfolio website 
In this README file I am keeping track of the progress of building this website. I am building this portfolio because it's good to have place where you can show your skills and this is also [a project from Codecademy]
## Project Objectives
* Build a website using HTML, CSS
* Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use the command line and file navigation
* Develop locally on your computer
* Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages

## Prerequisites:
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub

## The plan
Build a website with HTML and CSS an a bit of Javascript. For the JS part I am thinking of building a simple darkmode. 

The website wil contain:
* a header with My name in it , a menu with links to various parts of my portfolio.
* a main section with information about me, a picture, a list with projects I have done, My skills.
* a small footer
* a simple contact page

### Fonts (Google Fonts):
* Body: Poppins,Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif

* Main backgroundcolor: #080808: black

* Title(H1): 50px
* H2: 40px
* H3 30px
* Body: 20px

I'll use Icons from Font Awesome.

## Project steps overview according the project on Codecademy.com
### Plan your project 
For me this is the hardest to do, because I am not well at planning. I am going to spend a week to do each step and i'll adjust the plan if needed. 

### Wireframe your website 
I would like to use moqupes to Wireframe my website.

### Create files and deploy it Locally
After I made the Wireframes, I created 2 HTML files, 1 CSS file and a JS file (using Git). I'll add images for my portfolio sometime later. 

### Version control 
I imediately pushed everything to GitHub. It's not the first time i have lost my code somehow. On GitHub it's save. Now I am ready for the fun part! 

### Build the Home Page
Today I built the homepage in HTML. I also added pictures of all the projects, Icons, Font Awesome CDN and Google Fonts CDN.

### Build the Contact Page
I made the contactpage. I copied the header, the footer and one section from the homepage and I changed the content. This is the first time I am building a website with more than one page. 

### Style the content 
Styling two pages with one css file is harder than I thought. The first section on the homepage has the same layout as the contact page and still the picture won't move next to the text. 

And I messed up the columns for the projects section.

Two days later I finished the homepage! There's just one minor thing I'd like to have the borders in the header and the footer fullwidth, but I don't know yet how to do that.

I also finished the contactpage. I'll add responsiveness later. 

### Publish to the web
I published the website to GitHub pages.
